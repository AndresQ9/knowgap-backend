**Last Updated:** 11/14/2024  

---

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information through the Student At-Risk Predictor Chrome extension. This extension is designed to help educators and administrators identify students who may be at risk of underperformance, based on academic data accessed through Canvas.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage  

- **User Data**: The extension may collect and process information related to student performance, including grades, assignment completion, and other educational metrics. All information collected is retrieved directly from the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) through authorized API access.
- **API Usage**: The extension uses secure, custom-built API endpoints to pull real-time student performance data from Canvas. We do not store or share this data externally.
- **No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information unless it is directly provided within the Canvas data. Data is only used for displaying performance metrics within the extension interface to facilitate educator insights.

## 3. Data Security  
We prioritize the security of the data processed within this extension. All data retrieval and processing occur locally within the user’s browser and are encrypted during transmission. The extension does not transmit, store, or share any information outside of the user’s local environment.

## 4. Permissions and Access  
The Student At-Risk Predictor extension requests access to the Canvas LMS website solely for the purpose of retrieving and displaying student performance data. No other domains or services are accessed by the extension. Access is limited to the minimum permissions required for the extension’s intended functionality.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing  
We do not share, sell, or distribute any user data with third parties. All data processed by this extension is used solely for the purpose of providing academic performance insights.

## 6. User Control and Data Retention  
Users may uninstall the extension at any time, which will stop all data processing related to the extension. As no data is stored on our servers or within the extension beyond active browser memory, no data remains after the extension is disabled or removed.

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or relevant legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here with a revised "Last Updated" date.
