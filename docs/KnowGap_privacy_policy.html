    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information through the Student At-Risk Predictor Chrome extension. This extension is designed to help educators and administrators identify students who may be at risk of underperformance, based on academic data accessed through Canvas.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data</strong>: The extension may collect and process information related to student performance, including grades, assignment completion, and other educational metrics. All information collected is retrieved directly from the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) through authorized API access.</li>
        <li><strong>API Usage</strong>: The extension uses secure, custom-built API endpoints to pull real-time student performance data from Canvas. We do not store or share this data externally.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>: We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information unless it is directly provided within the Canvas data. Data is only used for displaying performance metrics within the extension interface to facilitate educator insights.</li>
    </ul>
