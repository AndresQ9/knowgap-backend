INSTRUCTOR TOKEN ISSUE RESOLUTION
================================

The instructor token "7~H8APDv4uCYRhQnCkz4NeYDuvVxrNHNNAZCGXV4uCaeXLmt6UhzueuvhFkBxnaReY" 
is getting "invalid token" error because:

✅ THE BACKEND IS WORKING CORRECTLY:
1. The token validation endpoint IS implemented and working
2. The backend IS validating tokens with Canvas API
3. The backend IS handling instructor token permissions properly

❌ THE ISSUE IS LIKELY:
1. The token format validation (tokens must be 64+ characters)
2. The token may be expired or invalid
3. The token may not have proper instructor permissions
4. Network connectivity to Canvas API

SOLUTION FOR THE INSTRUCTOR TOKEN:
==================================

1. ✅ VERIFY TOKEN FORMAT:
   - Canvas API tokens are typically 64+ characters long
   - The provided token appears to be the correct length
   - Check if the token is still valid in Canvas

2. ✅ TEST TOKEN WITH CANVAS DIRECTLY:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 7~H8APDv4uCYRhQnCkz4NeYDuvVxrNHNNAZCGXV4uCaeXLmt6UhzueuvhFkBxnaReY" \
        https://webcourses.ucf.edu/api/v1/users/self
   ```

3. ✅ TEST WITH BACKEND VALIDATION:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://gen-ai-prime-3ddeabb35bd7.herokuapp.com/auth/validate-canvas-token \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"canvasApiToken": "7~H8APDv4uCYRhQnCkz4NeYDuvVxrNHNNAZCGXV4uCaeXLmt6UhzueuvhFkBxnaReY", "canvasTokenType": "instructor"}'
   ```

4. ✅ CHECK INSTRUCTOR PERMISSIONS:
   - Verify the token has instructor access to courses
   - Check if the user is enrolled as an instructor in any courses
   - Ensure the token hasn't been revoked
