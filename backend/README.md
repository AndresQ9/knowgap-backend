# KnowGap Backend API

## Project Description

The KnowGap Backend API is designed to provide educational support for students by generating curated video recommendations and mental health resources based on their course interactions and performance. By leveraging machine learning and video content curation, KnowGap enhances the learning experience with targeted multimedia resources. This backend API enables seamless integration with educational platforms, offering services such as video recommendations, course context updates, mental health support videos, and user token management.

## Setup and Installation Guide (TODO)

This section will guide developers on setting up the project locally, installing dependencies, and configuring the environment. **(Details to be added)**

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Configure environment variables.
4. Run the application.

## Backend Directory Structure

The backend is organized into modular subdirectories, each serving a distinct purpose to keep the codebase maintainable and scalable. Below is an overview of the backend subdirectories and their roles:

### 1. `routes/`
This directory contains the route files that define the API endpoints, organized by functionality.

- **`base_routes.py`**: Manages foundational routes such as the root endpoint and health checks.
- **`video_routes.py`**: Handles all endpoints related to video management, including retrieval and updates.
- **`course_routes.py`**: Manages endpoints for course-related operations, such as updating course context and triggering video updates.
- **`user_token_management.py`**: Handles user token operations, including adding, updating, and retrieving tokens for secure access.

Each route file contains an `init_<route_name>_routes` function to register the routes with the main app instance.

### 2. `services/`
The services directory contains the core business logic and database interactions. Each service file corresponds to a specific feature or resource, separating business logic from the routing layer.

- **`video_service.py`**: Core video-related operations, including video recommendations, updates, and video retrieval based on course topics.
- **`course_service.py`**: Manages course-related operations, such as updating course contexts and handling course data.
- **`user_service.py`**: Handles user token operations, including encrypting, storing, and retrieving tokens securely.

These service files abstract the data layer, allowing routes to call specific functions to perform tasks without handling raw data operations directly.

### 3. `utils/`
Utility functions that support various parts of the application. Utilities are organized by purpose, and each file within this directory provides helper functions for different modules.

- **`encryption_utils.py`**: Provides functions for encrypting and decrypting user tokens to enhance security.
- **`youtube_utils.py`**: Contains helper functions for interacting with YouTubeâ€™s API, including video metadata retrieval and video ID extraction.
- **`ai_utils.py`**: Manages interactions with AI models, such as generating core topics for course videos based on course context.

The `utils` directory keeps helper logic separate, making it easier to maintain and reuse across the project.
